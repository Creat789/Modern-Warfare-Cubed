# Project Resources

These are essential resources for collaboration on our project. Here's a breakdown of each resource:

## Modding Guides and References

- **[Encyclopedia](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/Encyclopedia/tree/master/mod_development):** Our primary source of up-to-date information on 1.12 modding. It's not fully complete, but it is the most current resource available.

- **[Forge Documentation](https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/1.12.x/):** This is an additional source for 1.12 modding. It's more comprehensive than the Encyclopedia but less up-to-date. Always consult the Encyclopedia first before referring to these docs.

- **[Docs on Making Content for VM 3.0 (Outdated and Incomplete)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KdhebS9IvfVSVrDXh_PgbRCqjpzz8muIJwQapOHE7Ec/edit):** This document contains historical information for creating content for VM 3.0. Use it for reference on past practices.

## Community and Collaboration

- **[Cleanroom Discord](https://discord.gg/jXTBfm27Vf):** A crucial community resource for assistance. Make sure to try finding a solution on your own before reaching out.

- **[Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Paneedah/Modern-Warfare-Cubed/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md):** Before you start contributing, make sure to read this guide. It'll help you understand our contribution policies and procedures.

- **[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Uaxz6Khc/modern-warfare-cubed):** Our project management tool. You can use it to see what others are working on, track your own tasks, and identify new tasks to pick up. (If you are not a member of the board and you want to be one contact me in DM's)
